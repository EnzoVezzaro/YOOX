      <h2>LE CYCLOPE ARDENT -THE SOFTNESS OF CERAMICS AND THE RICHNESS OF PRECIOUS METALS</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-8 text_align_left news_text">
      <p>Cutting-edge French design brand Moustache joins forces with the leading virtual store for multi-brand fashion
        and design in the world, yoox.com, to create an exciting new product - Le Cyclope Ardent, available exclusively
        on yoox.com from the end of March 2012.
        The Cyclope mirror, designed by young French designer Ionna Vautrin, gets its name from the convex mirrors,
        (which in French are called ‘witches' eyes) - Vautrin takes this magical object and perches it atop a soft cone crafted
        from clay, creating a table-top mirror with a distinctly sculptural feel, evoking the mysterious monolithic statues of
        far-off primitive cultures or the minimal eloquence of sculptors like Brancusi and Moore.
        Originally available in a matt ceramic finish, for yoox.com, Vautrin has created 3 new and unique new versions – Le
        Cyclope Ardent. Le Cyclope Ardent is coated in a lustrous hi-gloss metallic finish, 3 different metals chosen for their
        evocative richness, luster and sophistication: opulent gold, elegant platinum and warm, alluring copper. Like a sculpture
        for the home, Le Cyclope Ardent sits atop any table or desk and gazes out at the world around it, offering users a glimpse
        into a strange and intriguing vision of the world. </p>
